Hi, thank you for your visit.

I am a software engineer and am working as a full stack web developer. I am coming from a forestry background and have been
developing software since 2011.

Please have a look at my [Github repositories](https://github.com/bar9?tab=repositories), especially
if you hope to find some idea I haven't found the time to carry forward.
I just keep producing those, which is a bit sad.

If you could see way of engaging in an open source project with me, or discuss any ideas, feel free to contact me.
