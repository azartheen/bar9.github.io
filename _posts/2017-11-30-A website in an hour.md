After a really long summer full of work I have to seize the moment and work on something which
has been on my to do list for quite some time now: Creating my personal home page.

With only about an hour at hand, how to achieve this?


## Jekyll

With the state of the art in static site generators, this is possible (and so far for free).
Thanks to [Akshay Agarwal](https://github.com/AkshayAgarwal007/Jekyll-Mono) for providing a cool
template to star with.
