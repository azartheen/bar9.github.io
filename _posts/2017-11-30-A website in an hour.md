title: A website within an hour?
author: Roland Brand

After a summer full of work, I needed to seize the moment and work on something on my to do list:
Creating my personal home page.

With only about an hour at hand, how to achieve this?


## Jekyll

With the state of the art in static site generators, this is possible (and so far for free).
Thanks to [Akshay Agarwal](https://github.com/AkshayAgarwal007/Jekyll-Mono) for providing a cool
template to star with.
Of course you can't really build a website in an hour. Much refinement content completion and the addition
of new features will follow. So it is at most the first iteration that is possible within an hour.
