We are living in the information age; the frequency of new technologies popping up is astounding.
The "new stuff" is always better it seems, and if you're not catching up you're old fashioned. 
In software development this is true as well. But is wise to always chase after the shiny new? X reasons why maybe not:

* Test coverage


The information age means new languages and frameworks pop up every year, package and source repositories
are growing at an exponential rate. Paradigms, processes and methodologies evolve in a comparable pace. 
In consequence, as developers, once we really master any of these tools, they are already labeled _stone age_.

For half a century, new technologies have been claiming to be revolutionary, to help us _take the next step_, 
maybe even do the programming for us one day. 
This has not happened so far, and through the perception of sofware customers, applications
have probably taken incremental steps, but no exponential improvements as expected.

Yet, if you 
* who doesn't, is lazy, old-fashioned, in many respects
* stubborn, afraid, fearful
but the fear is often quite rational
* new stuff must be incubated first
* if you volunteer to be the incubator, thank you from society. But it will trouble you.
* Slight or even substantial productivity gains are not worth the risk of distaster
* Reliability and maturity is what you want. 
In time, the cool, new , more productive tool will be mature as well (or have died). Take it up then. Best pracices will
have emerged.
