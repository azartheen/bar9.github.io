Programming beginners are confronted with the difficult choice of their first language. First of all:
Don't listen to the camps of a "superior" language and to flame wars. It does not matter that much.
There are more important things. Here's a list of things you will need to learn regardless of language.
They all are not coupled to any language, so they could even be learned before learning to program.

Version control
Versioning
Encodings
Sockets
Build time vs Runtime
Data Structures
Data types
Stdin/Stdout/Stderr, args
Domain Modelling
...

Why did I not mention unit testing and debugging? Because despite their importance and similarity across languages,
they are still tightly coupled to their respective language runtime.
