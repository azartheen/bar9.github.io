title: Why we should constantly fight complexity

In software engineering, complexity is your biggest enemy. Once you sacrifice simplicity for the
sake of velocity or even advance in general, complexity will haunt you in all its ugliness.

As software engineers we might be doing very different things. We might painstakingly manage
the memory footprint of embedded software, we might be finding ways to train a machine
learning model within hours instead of weeks, or we might be looking for an index mechanism that 
balances fast data access and required storage consumption of a data store.

So some of us have to think mainly like mathematicians, some not at all.
While our profiles might be different, all software engineers have one essential thing
in common: We *must* avoid complexity, even constantly reduce it.

## domain complexity
* the worst kind

## runtime complexity
* manageable, given the right tools

## false simplicity
* when it looks clean and simple on the surface, but ist a hopeless mess beyond
